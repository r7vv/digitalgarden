# [[Digital Gardcen/2 - What is a Digital Garden\|2 - What is a Digital Garden]]
A digital garden is a structure of a collection of notes taken/written by a person.
The notes are meant to be interconnected to each other so as a reader naturally reads through it, they can follow the trail of thoughts and gather more insights and knowledge.
It is a place to build & learn things.

As for this digital garden. This is my obsidian vault, half of it is published notes and a semi-half of them are private notes which form the other half of the vault.

Most of my notes derive from my daily journal.
Though they are not being published. There will be other notes that will.

This is a place where one's mind is written and painted in an organized manner.

Either the reader or even the writer can read and reflect on the notes.
