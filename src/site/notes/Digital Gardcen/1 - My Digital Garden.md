# [[Digital Gardcen/1 - My Digital Garden\|1 - My Digital Garden]]
Hi, I am enam.
Welcome to my digital garden. This is my vault.


Confused about what an [[Meta/Definations/Obsidian vault\|Obsidian vault]] is?

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




**Obsidian MD** is a digital note-taking app.

Instead of you regular notebook and a pen. Obsidian is a vault where it stores all your notes inside it.
And those notes, which you can share them or just keep them for your record.

For me, I have decided on a mixed approach.

In this vault, I have set a [[Digital Gardcen/1 - My Digital Garden\|digital garden]] where I can both share the notes and also keep the personal notes to myself, like my day2day journal and etc.

# Plans for the vault?
1. [[Notes/Vault's integration with AI\|Vault's integration with AI]]
	- I plan on indexing all my daily notes to a relevant and dependable AI model to make a memory which I can later use for my advantage on many purposes. This will make retrieving information way easier later on.
	- [[Journal/Daily/2025/01-January/2025-01-23\|2025-01-23]] 08:13 PM, I have found a better way - more on it [[Notes/Vault's integration with AI\|here]].
1. Digital garden
	- I plan on setting up a digital garden which I can later use or share with anyone
	- Not so soon tho. Maybe some time later on.
2. Wisory notes
		- Notes with different points sharing different insights on different situations and different perspectives.
	1. [[z/My personal rules\|Personal rules]]
		- A note featuring my personal rules which I will try and maintain over the years and eventually become an ideal person accordingly
	2. [[z/Points of life\|Points of life]]
		- Points of life that I discovered on my way while living life.
	3. [[z/Brain breathers\|Brain breathers]]
		- In short, a note with motivational type lines. 
		- Not exactly motivation, but something real since [[z/motivation doesn't really work\|motivation doesn't really work]] in my opinion.
